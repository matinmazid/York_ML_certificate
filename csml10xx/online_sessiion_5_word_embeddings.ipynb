        "In this project, I classify Yelp round-10 review datasets. The reviews contain a lot of metadata that can be mined and used to infer meaning, business attributes, and sentiment. For simplicity, I classify the review comments into two class: either as positive or negative. Reviews that have star higher than three are regarded as positive while the reviews with star less than or equal to 3 are negative. Therefore, the problem is a supervised learning. To build and train the model, I first tokenize the text and convert them to sequences. Each review comment is limited to 50 words. As a result, short texts less than 50 words are padded with zeros, and long ones are truncated. After processing the review comments, I trained three model in three different ways:\n",
        "\n",
        "<li> Model-1: In this model, a neural network with LSTM and a single embedding layer were used.\n",
        "<li> Model-2: In Model-1, an extra 1D convolutional layer has been added on top of LSTM layer to reduce the training time.\n",
        "<li> Model-3:  In this model, I use the same network architecture as Model-2, but use the pre-trained glove 100 dimension word embeddings as initial input.\n",
        "\n",
        "Since there are about 1.6 million input comments, it takes a while to train the models. To reduce the training time step, I limit the training epoch to three. After three epochs, it is evident that Model-2 is better regarding both training time and validation accuracy."

On several occasions, We witnessed the salad \\\"chef\\\" amble past our table and continue on to serve guests who had arrived after us. He didn't display any sense of efficiency or alertness. His only job is to make salad. Yet, we just sat there and waited for somebody or something to arrive. \\n\\nThe server was attentive and polite. When she discovered that we'd been skipped over by salad boy, she apologized and tried to make it right. She was left with no choice but to make the salads herself, which obviously put a dent in her rhythm. We appreciated her initiative.\\n\\nOver An hour after we ordered food, the entrees finally showed up. The food was good but not outstanding. We were never offered freshly ground pepper.
